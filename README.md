# Guitar Hero-like Game (Functional Reactive Programming with Observables)

## Overview
This project is a simplified version of a Guitar Hero game created as part of a functional programming assignment. It leverages Observables to manage game states and user input in a reactive manner, demonstrating principles of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and immutability.

## Features
- **Reactive Game Mechanics**: Uses observables to track player input and sync it with game actions.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks player scores based on accurate timing with notes.
- **Functional Principles**: Focuses on immutability and pure functions, minimizing side effects.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- RxJS (for handling observables)
- HTML & CSS for the game interface

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
- Use the specified keys to play along with the game as notes appear on the screen.
- Match the notes to score points and improve timing accuracy.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed for a functional programming course, with inspiration from classic rhythm games like Guitar Hero.
